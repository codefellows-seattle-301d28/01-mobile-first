## Overview

have the website be mobile first layout and have it adjust to a website look once it gets passed a width. this will help be mobile friendly.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? --> figure out what they are building it for? web or mobile.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->  we are using a few outside venders to help us with the icons and we are using CSS to do all the hard work that JS or JQ would be doing it.
