##Project name: 01-mobile-first

**Author**: Karen Perez
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is a blog.  The user would like it to look great on all viewports.  The technical goal is to implement a mobile-first design using responsive web design techniques.

## Getting Started
In order to run this, git clone the repo and then type "live-server' in the terminal to display the webpage in a browser window.

## Architecture
The application design, at this point, uses HTML and CSS files to display the blog.  Specifically, the index.html file holds the structure file.  The CSS is handled using SMACSS protocol and has base.css, layout.css and modules.css.  The icons used are in icons.css.

## Change Log
