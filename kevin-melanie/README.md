# Mobile First

**Author**: Melanie Downing, Kevin Miller
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Create a blog site that is user friendly to encourage people to come back frequently. It needs to render responsively on mobile devices and desktop.

## Getting Started
It is necessary to download the code and have live server installed to open the blog as it is not a published website yet.

## Architecture
Currently, this is a single page application using HTML5 and CSS3 languages. We also used open source icons and fonts at IcoMoon (https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).

## Change Log
