# 01-Mobile-First
Author: Jordan Van Ness and Richard Montgomery
Version: 1.0.0

Overview:
It's a Lorem Ipsum Blog full of Lorem Ipsums with dynamic CSS including a media query for mobile viewport.

Getting Started:
Fork, clone, code. Almost the entire content was provided us. We completed a meta tag and linked CSS stylesheets in the HTML as per requested by TODOs. From there, we focused on CSS Styles and half attempted SMACSS.

Architecture:
HTML and CSS. The outline of the project was to produce a hover hamburger menu in mobile view. We first focused on mobile view CSS styles and used a media query to establish a fixed width. Then we finished the desktop CSS.
